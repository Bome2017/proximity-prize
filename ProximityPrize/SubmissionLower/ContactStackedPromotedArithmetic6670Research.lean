# Exact split-budget arithmetic for the stacked score-66.96 target

This file freezes only the six independently rounded components of the
`a = 182414` recursive-GCD ledger.  The fixed regular component uses the
accepted active-YZ tail and equal-weight Taylor direction; the fixed singular
component and both residual singular components use the tight
implicit-core-plus-exceptions ledger.

The geometric providers and profile-specific identifications are deliberately
kept in separate modules.  This arithmetic consumer only joins an exact
three-cell partition once those bounds have been supplied.
